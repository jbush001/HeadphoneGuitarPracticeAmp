I was looking for a headphone guitar amp with the following features:

- Integrated guitar plug: Doesn't require an extra cable or have a box
  flopping around.
- Rechargeable battery
- Flexible set of basic effects with decent quality: distortion, reverb,
  amp simulation, etc.
- Built-in metronome

Although there are commercially available headphone amps that support a few of
these, surprisingly, none supported all of them, so I decided to build my own.

This is still a work in progress and has not been fabricated or tested yet.
