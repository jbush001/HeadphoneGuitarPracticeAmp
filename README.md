I was looking for a headphone guitar amp with the following features:

- Integrated guitar plug: Doesn't require an extra cable or have a box
  flopping around.
- Rechargeable battery
- Flexible set of basic effects with decent quality: distortion, reverb,
  amp simulation, etc.
- Built-in metronome

Although there are commercially available headphone amps that support a few of
these, surprisingly, none supported all of them, so I decided to build my own.
The heart of this is an ARM microcontroller, which processes the audio signal
and applies digital effects. The hardware consists of a custom printed circuit
board in a 3D printed enclosure.

TBH, I kind of ran out of steam on this project. Pictures of the prototype I built
are in the Wiki: <https://github.com/jbush001/HeadphoneGuitarPracticeAmp/wiki/Prototype-Pictures>,
but I didn't end up bringing this up.
